# Continuous delivery in Azure DevOps before the hands-on lab setup guide for on-premise IIS and SQL

## Requirements

1.  Microsoft Azure DevOps organisation and accounts.

2.  Developer - Local machine or a virtual machine configured with: 

    -   Visual Studio Community 2017
    
    -   SQL Server Management Studio (Optional)

2.  Servers - Local machine or a virtual machine configured with:

    -   Powershell with Administrator privileges
    
    -   IIS

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 30 minutes

In this lab, you will create a developer environment and download the required files for this course if you do not already have one that meets the requirements.

### Prerequisites

-   Microsoft Azure Devops account <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/devops/>

-   Client computer with Windows 7 or later with Visual Studio 2017

### Task 1: Configure a development environment

If you do not have a machine setup with Visual Studio 2017 Community, complete this task.

1.  At the Azure web portal, create a virtual machine in Azure using the Visual Studio Community 2017 on Windows Server 2016 image.

    ![This is a screenshot of a results window of a search on visual studio community 2017. The results table has the following columns: Name, Publisher, and Category. The second result is highlighted and has the following values: Visual Studio Community 2017 on Windows Server 2016 (x64), Microsoft, and Compute.](images/Setup/image3.png "Virtual machine creation screenshot")

    > It is **highly** recommended to use a DS2_v2 or D2s_v3 instance size for this VM.

    > You will also need to make sure to enable RDP (port 3389) inbound access to the VM.

### Task 2: Disable IE enhanced security

>**Note:** Sometimes this image has IE ESC disabled, and sometimes it does not.

1.  On the new VM, you just created click the Server Manager icon.

    ![Server Manager icon is highlighted on the taskbar.](images/Setup/image4.png "Server Manager icon")

    Click Local Server.

    ![Local Server is selected and highlighted in the Server Manager menu.](images/Setup/image5.png "Server Manager menu")

2.  On the right side of the pane, click **On** by IE Enhanced Security Configuration.

    ![Next to IE Enhanced Security Configuration, On is highlighted.](images/Setup/image6.png "IE Enhanced Security Configuration On")

3.  Change to **Off** for Administrators, and click **OK**.

    ![In the Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration dialog box, under Administrators, Off is selected and highlighted. At the bottom, the OK button is highlighted.](images/Setup/image7.png "Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration dialog box")

### Task 3: Validate connectivity to SQL database

1.  From within the virtual machine, Launch Visual Studio 2017 and validate that you can login with your Microsoft Account when prompted.

2.  Validate connectivity to your SQL server with either of following options. 

  - Launch Visual Studio, open SQL Server Object Explorer from the View menu, and ensure you can connect to your SQL server using SQL authentication.
  
  - Launch SQL Server Management Studio, ensure you can connect to your SQL server using SQL authentication.

    ![In Visual Studio Server Explorer, the submenu for the Azure subscription displays with the following options: Refresh, Connect to Microsoft Azure Subscription, Manage and Filter Subscriptions, and Open Getting Started Page.](images/Setup/image8.png "Visual Studio Server Explorer")

**Download the exercise files**

1.  Download the exercise files for the training (from within the virtual machine).

    -   Create a new folder on your computer named **C:\\Hackathon**.

    -   Download the support files (.zip format), https://improjectfilescw.blob.core.windows.net/countrywidedemoproject/CWdemo.zip to the new folder.

    -   Extract the contents to the **C:\\Hackathon** folder.


You should follow all steps provided *before* attending the hands-on lab.
